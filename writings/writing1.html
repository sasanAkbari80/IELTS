      <p>Traffic is a great problem that most of big cities all around the world are facing right now. There are many possible solutions for this matter although we are going to discuss increasing the paid tax of private car owners. </p>
      <p>As the matter of fact people don't care about government negative advertisement of single driver cars and keep using their cars for even short destinations because of the lack of force but the benefit of this solution is that no one can refuse to pay their taxes. It also provide the budget needed to renew and improve public transportation system. </p>
      <p>Despite of it's advantages, there are some drawbacks too. It affect's on many people job. As we know in 21st centry most of the people have access to internet and so many jobs depend on it, online private taxi included. Many online taxi services are using private car owners as their drivers. So if you intend to work for Uber you should consider other job opportunities.</p>
      <p>In my opinion rising tax prices is an effective even though not an effisient solution.</p>
